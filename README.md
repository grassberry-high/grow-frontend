# Coding Guidlines

..1. Use separate branches for separate problems, feel free to push to master afterwards

..2. More code is read than written, be specific in variable names

..3. Small commits, commit the smallest unit

..4. Write unit tests on critical functions, write unit tests where they are missing

..5. No duplicate code, if code is needed twice, use classes, functions etc.

..6. Write comments, readme if something is not 100% self explaining

..7. SignOff your commits with `git commit --signoff`
